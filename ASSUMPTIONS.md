# Assumptions

- The values of each node are always 32-bit signed integers separated by a single space.
- The input creates a perfect triangle, i.e. the first line contains one number and each subsequent line contains exactly one more number than the line preceding it
- When calculating the length of any given path, the value will always be less than 2^31 (so as to prevent integer overflow)
